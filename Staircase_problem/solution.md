As stairs are the example of arithimatic progression and ground floor is consider to be 0 so the series will be generated as following


20 , 40, 60 , ........................... 800

so , 

A + (n-1) * D  = 800

where initial level A = 20
constant distance  D = 20
and n = No. of staircases

20 + (n-1)*20 = 800
20 + 20n - 20 = 800 
20n = 800
n = 40

So, Ryotsu has to climb 40 staircases.
